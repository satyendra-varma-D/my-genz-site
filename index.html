  <!-- PERSPECTIVE / ABOUT -->
  <section id="about">
    <h2>Why I Exist in This Ecosystem</h2>

    <p>
      I am an ERP Business Analyst and Operations Consultant with over two years of
      hands-on experience delivering end-to-end ERP implementations across
      procurement, inventory, warehouse, and transportation domains.
    </p>

    <p>
      My core strength lies in bridging business stakeholders and technical teams.
      I translate operational challenges into structured system requirements through
      requirement workshops, AS-IS / TO-BE process mapping, and detailed BRD/FRD documentation.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have worked extensively in oil & gas–driven fleet and logistics environments,
      supporting large-scale operations where accuracy, compliance, and system reliability
      are non-negotiable. My focus is always on building systems that work under real operational pressure.
